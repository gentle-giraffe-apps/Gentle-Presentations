# Signals That Are Hard to Fake

- Commit history that tells a story
- Tests that reflect real edge cases
- CI that actually runs
- Architecture docs that show tradeoffs
- Code review habits — even on your own PRs

---

These are boring.

But they show how you behave on a team.

<!--
Speaker notes:
These are the things AI can help you with, but can't fully do for you. You can ask an LLM to write tests, but the choice of what to test — the weird edge case you caught because you've seen it in production — that's you. Same with architecture decisions. AI can generate a diagram, but the "why" behind it is yours. These are the signals that hold up under scrutiny.
