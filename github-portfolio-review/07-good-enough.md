# "Good Enough" Depends on Your Goal

| Goal | What matters most |
|---|---|
| **Job search** | 1–2 strong repos, clear READMEs, evidence of judgment |
| **Contracting / consulting** | Working demos, documentation, proof you ship |
| **Open-source credibility** | Contribution history, issue engagement, maintainer habits |
| **Just learning** | Honest commit history, notes-to-self, progression over time |

And sometimes the right answer is: **no portfolio at all.**

If your best work is proprietary, say so. That's valid.

<!--
Speaker notes:
Not everyone needs a portfolio. If you've spent ten years building internal systems at a company, your GitHub being empty doesn't mean you're not skilled. It means your work is behind an NDA. A brief "about me" repo that describes your experience without leaking anything is totally fine. The point is to be intentional — don't build a portfolio because LinkedIn told you to. Build one if it actually serves your goals.
