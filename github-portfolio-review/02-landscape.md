# The Landscape Has Changed

- AI tools can generate impressive-looking repos in minutes
- "Portfolio advice" online is louder and more contradictory than ever
- Hiring managers are adapting — some faster than others
- The bar hasn't gone up. It's shifted.

The question isn't "how do I make my repo look good?"

It's "what actually signals something real about me?"

Speaker notes:
A year or two ago, having a clean repo with a README and some tests was a differentiator. Now AI can scaffold that in seconds. So the question isn't "how do I make my repo look good" — it's "what actually signals something real about me?" That's what we're here to talk through.
