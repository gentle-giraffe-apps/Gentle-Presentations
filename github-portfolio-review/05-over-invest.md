# Where People Over-Invest

- Pixel-perfect demo sites for projects nobody will run
- Badge collections that don't reflect real practice
- Polished READMEs on throwaway experiments
- Rewriting everything to look "production-ready"
- Trying to mass-produce repos to fill a grid

---

A half-finished project with honest commit messages can be more compelling than a polished one that looks generated.

<!--
Speaker notes:
I've definitely fallen into this. You spend a weekend making the README gorgeous and the demo deploy flawless for a project that's basically a tutorial. Meanwhile the thing that actually shows your skills — the messy one where you wrestled with a real problem — is sitting in a private repo. If you're going to spend time, spend it on the thing that's hardest to fake.
