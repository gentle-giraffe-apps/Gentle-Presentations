# GitHub Is Not Social Media

<br>

### ⭐ Low star count? Nobody who's hiring you cares.

### 👤 Few followers? Irrelevant to your engineering ability.

### 😶 Don't let vanity metrics stop you from shipping real work.

### 👍 Starring repos you use and following people you learn from shows engagement — and it shows on your profile

> ## Your best project has 3 stars. So does almost everyone's. Post it anyway.

Speaker notes:
This is a big one. I talk to engineers who are genuinely embarrassed to share their GitHub because they have low stars or no followers. They treat it like Instagram — like the numbers reflect their worth. They don't. Stars measure marketing and luck, not engineering. Most internal tools, most real-world production code, most things that actually matter — zero stars. Hiring managers aren't checking your star count. They're reading your code and your README. Don't let a vanity metric keep you from putting real work out there.
