# Let's Discuss

Pick any of these — or bring your own:

1. **What's the last thing you noticed on someone's GitHub that actually changed your impression of them — positively or negatively?**

2. **Have you seen AI-generated repos in the wild (as a reviewer or interviewer)? What tipped you off? Did it matter?**

3. **Where do you personally draw the line between "good enough" and "over-polished"? Has that line moved recently?**

4. **For those actively interviewing: has anyone actually asked about your GitHub? What did they focus on?**

5. **What's one thing you'd change about your own GitHub presence if you had a free weekend?**
