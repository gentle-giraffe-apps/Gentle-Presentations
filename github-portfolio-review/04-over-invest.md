# Where People Over-Invest

## Pixel-perfect demos for projects nobody will run

## Badge collections that don't reflect real practice

## Polished READMEs on throwaway experiments

## Mass-producing repos to fill a contribution grid

---

# A half-finished project with honest commits can beat a polished one that looks generated.

Speaker notes:
I've fallen into this. You spend a weekend making a README gorgeous for what's basically a tutorial — meanwhile the messy repo where you actually wrestled with a real problem is sitting private. Spend time on the thing that's hardest to fake.
