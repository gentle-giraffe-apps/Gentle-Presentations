Whether you're job searching, contracting, doing open source, or just learning — different goals, different signals, but the principle is the same. The commit history and the decisions you made along the way are what matter most. You don't need to wait until something is polished. Having something beats having nothing. And once your profile is in shape, make sure the link is prominent on your resume and LinkedIn — if they can't find it, it doesn't exist.
