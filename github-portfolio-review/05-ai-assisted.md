# AI-Assisted Code

## What helps:
### Scaffold with AI, then build on top of it
### Be transparent about what you used
### Directing AI well is a real, demonstrable skill

<br>

## What hurts:
### Repos that are obviously generated with no human layer
### Claiming fully original work when it clearly isn't

---

# The question isn't whether you used AI. It's whether *you* were driving.

<!--
Speaker notes:
Nobody reasonable expects you to avoid AI tools. If your repo looks like you prompted an LLM and hit "accept all" — that's one signal. If you used AI to get started and then made real decisions on top — that's another. Being upfront about it is a strength.
