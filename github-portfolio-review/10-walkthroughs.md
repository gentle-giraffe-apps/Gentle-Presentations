# Optional: Live Repo Walkthroughs

- Anyone want feedback on a specific repo or profile?
- No pressure — share a link in chat if you'd like
- We can look at structure, README clarity, commit patterns, whatever is useful

---

No judgment. The whole point is to help each other see what we might be missing.

Speaker notes:
If anyone wants to share a repo or their profile for the group to look at, we can do that. Totally optional. You can drop a link in chat and we'll pull it up, or you can screenshare. No judgment — the whole point is to help each other see what we might be missing.
