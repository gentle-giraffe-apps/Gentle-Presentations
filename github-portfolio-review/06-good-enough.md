# "Good Enough" Depends on Your Goal

## **Job search** — 1–2 strong repos, clear READMEs, evidence of judgment

## **Contracting** — Working demos, documentation, proof you ship

## **Open source** — Contribution history, issue engagement, maintainer habits

## **Learning** — Honest commit history, notes-to-self, progression

# Sometimes the right answer is no portfolio at all.

### If your best work is proprietary, say so. That's valid.

<!--
Speaker notes:
Not everyone needs a portfolio. Ten years of internal systems behind an NDA doesn't make you unskilled — it makes you employed. A brief "about me" repo explaining your experience is fine. Be intentional. Don't build a portfolio because LinkedIn told you to.
