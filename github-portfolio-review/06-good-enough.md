# "Good Enough" Depends on Your Goal

### 💼 **Job search** — 1–2 strong repos, clear READMEs, evidence of judgment

### 🤝 **Contracting** — Working demos, documentation, proof you ship

### 🌐 **Open source** — Contribution history, issue engagement, maintainer habits

### 📚 **Learning** — Honest commit history, notes-to-self, progression

---

> ## Activity beats perfection.
>
> #### Start barebones. Commit as you go. Share it when you're ready.
>
> #### The history *is* the portfolio.

Speaker notes:
You don't need to wait until something is polished to put it on GitHub. Start a repo, keep it private if you want, commit as you work. The history you build along the way — the iteration, the decisions, the progression — that's the thing that's hardest to fake and most impressive to reviewers. If your best work is proprietary, build something small on the side that shows how you think. Having *something* beats having nothing.
