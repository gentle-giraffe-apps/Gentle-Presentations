# "Good Enough" Depends on Your Goal

### 💼 **Job search** — 1–2 strong repos, clear READMEs, evidence of judgment

### 🤝 **Contracting** — Working demos, documentation, proof you ship

### 🌐 **Open source** — Contribution history, issue engagement, maintainer habits

### 📚 **Learning** — Honest commit history, notes-to-self, progression

<!--
Speaker notes:
Not everyone needs a portfolio. Ten years of internal systems behind an NDA doesn't make you unskilled — it makes you employed. A brief "about me" repo explaining your experience is fine. Be intentional. Don't build a portfolio because LinkedIn told you to.
