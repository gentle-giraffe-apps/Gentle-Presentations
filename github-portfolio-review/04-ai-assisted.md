# AI-Assisted Code

### 🛠 Scaffold with AI, then build on top of it

### 🪟 Be transparent about what you used

### 🧠 Directing AI well is a real, demonstrable skill

### 🚫 But repos with no human layer are obvious — and so is claiming otherwise

> ## The question isn't whether you used AI. It's whether *you* were driving.

<!--
Speaker notes:
Nobody reasonable expects you to avoid AI tools. If your repo looks like you prompted an LLM and hit "accept all" — that's one signal. If you used AI to get started and then made real decisions on top — that's another. Being upfront about it is a strength.
