# High ROI Moves — Whatever Your Goal

<br>

### 📌 **Audit your pinned repos** — every pin is a signal. Make sure it's the one you want to send.

### 📖 **README "above the fold"** — what does this project do, in ~5 seconds? A screenshot or setup example goes a long way.

### 🏷 **Badges that mean something** — build status, platform support, test coverage

> ## The history *is* the portfolio. Start barebones. Commit as you go.

<!--
Speaker notes:
Whether you're job searching, contracting, doing open source, or just learning — different goals, different signals, but the principle is the same. The commit history and the decisions you made along the way are what matter most. You don't need to wait until something is polished. Having something beats having nothing. And once your profile is in shape, make sure the link is prominent on your resume and LinkedIn — if they can't find it, it doesn't exist.
