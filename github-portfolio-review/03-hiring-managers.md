# What Hiring Managers Actually Scan For

- **Judgment, not volume** — nobody reads 40 repos
- Evidence you made decisions and can explain them
- Signs of iteration (commit history, refactors, TODOs addressed)
- Clarity of communication (README, PR descriptions, code comments)
- Does this person think about users, tradeoffs, maintainability?

---

One repo where you clearly *thought* beats a hundred green squares.

<!--
Speaker notes:
I've been on both sides of this recently. When I'm reviewing someone's GitHub, I'm not counting repos. I'm looking for one or two things where I can tell this person thought about what they were building. A README that says "I chose X over Y because of Z" tells me more than a hundred green squares.
