# What This Is Not

- Not LeetCode prep
- Not resume rewriting
- Not a recruiter pitch
- Not a flex contest

---

This is a room full of experienced people comparing notes.

<!--
Speaker notes:
I want to be clear about what we're doing here. There's no "right answer" presentation coming. I have opinions, you have opinions, and the most useful thing we can do is compare notes honestly. Some of you have hired people. Some of you are interviewing right now. Some of you are just recalibrating. All of that is useful context for this conversation.
