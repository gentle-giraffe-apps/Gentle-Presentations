# AI-Assisted Code: What Helps and What Hurts

**What helps:**
- Using AI to scaffold boilerplate, then building on top of it
- Being transparent: "bootstrapped with Cursor/Copilot, customized X, Y, Z"
- Showing you can direct AI tools effectively — that's a real skill now

**What hurts:**
- Repos that are obviously fully generated with no human layer
- Over-polished code with no sign of the person behind it
- Claiming work as fully original when it clearly isn't

The question isn't whether you used AI.

It's whether I can tell *you* were driving.

<!--
Speaker notes:
Nobody reasonable expects you to avoid AI tools. The question is: can I tell you were driving? If your repo looks like you prompted an LLM and hit "accept all," that's a different signal than if you used AI to get started and then made real decisions on top of it. Honestly, showing you can use AI tools well is a legitimate skill worth demonstrating — just be upfront about it.
