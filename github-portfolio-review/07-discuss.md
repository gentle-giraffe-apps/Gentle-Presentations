# Let's Discuss

## What's the last thing you noticed on someone's GitHub that changed your impression of them?

## Have you seen AI-generated repos in the wild? What tipped you off?

## Where do you draw the line between "good enough" and "over-polished"?

## For those interviewing: has anyone actually asked about your GitHub?

## What would you change about your GitHub if you had a free weekend?

---

# Pick any of these, bring your own, or share a repo for live feedback.

### No judgment. The whole point is to help each other see what we're missing.
