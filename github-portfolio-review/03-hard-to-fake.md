Speaker notes:
Hiring managers scan for judgment, not volume. Nobody reads 40 repos. One where you clearly thought about what you built — "I chose X over Y because Z" — beats a hundred green squares. AI can help with all of this, but the choice of *what* to test and *why* you made an architecture decision — that's you.
