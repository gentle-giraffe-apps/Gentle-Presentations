# Signals That Are Hard to Fake

## Commit history that tells a story

## Tests that reflect real edge cases

## CI that actually runs

## Tradeoff explanations in docs or READMEs

## Code review habits — even on your own PRs

Speaker notes:
Hiring managers scan for judgment, not volume. Nobody reads 40 repos. One where you clearly thought about what you built — "I chose X over Y because Z" — beats a hundred green squares. AI can help with all of this, but the choice of *what* to test and *why* you made an architecture decision — that's you.
