# Signals That Are Hard to Fake

### ✅ CI that actually runs

### ⚖️ Tradeoff explanations in docs or READMEs

### 🔍 Code review habits — even on your own PRs

Speaker notes:
Hiring managers scan for judgment, not volume. Nobody reads 40 repos. One where you clearly thought about what you built — "I chose X over Y because Z" — beats a hundred green squares. People over-invest in polished READMEs on throwaway experiments and mass-producing repos to fill a grid. Meanwhile the messy repo where you wrestled with a real problem is sitting private. Spend time on the thing that's hardest to fake.
