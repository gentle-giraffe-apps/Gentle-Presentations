# High ROI Moves

### 📖 **A clear, concise README "above the fold"**
#### Answerable in ~5 seconds: what does this project do?
#### A screenshot, animated gif, or minimal setup example
#### Minimal scrolling — value the reader's time

<br>

### 🏷 **Badges that actually mean something**
#### ✅ Build passing — your project compiles
#### 📱 Platform support — what it runs on
#### 🧪 Test coverage — if you have it, show it

---

> ## If someone lands on your repo and can't tell what it does in 5 seconds, nothing else matters.

<!--
Speaker notes:
This is where a little polish goes a long way. You don't need to over-invest, but the first screenful of your README is prime real estate. A one-liner description, a screenshot or code snippet, and a couple of honest badges — that's it. Badges for build status, platform support, and test coverage are high signal because they're backed by something real. Skip the decorative ones.
