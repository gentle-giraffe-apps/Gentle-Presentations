# AI Raised the Floor. These Signals Still Matter.

### 📜 Commit history that tells a story

### 🧪 Tests that reflect real edge cases

### ✅ CI that actually runs

### ⚖️ Tradeoff explanations in docs or READMEs

### 🔍 Code review habits — even on your own PRs

Speaker notes:
AI can generate impressive-looking repos in minutes now. Hiring managers are adapting — the bar hasn't gone up, it's moved. They scan for judgment, not volume. Nobody reads 40 repos. One where you clearly thought about what you built — "I chose X over Y because Z" — beats a hundred green squares. People over-invest in polished READMEs on throwaway experiments. Spend time on the thing that's hardest to fake.
