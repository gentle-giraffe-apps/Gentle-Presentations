# AI Raised the Floor. These Signals Still Matter.

<br>

### 📜 PRs and commit history that show how you work — iteration, decisions, progression

### 🧪 Test coverage above 80% via CI — visible at a glance, strong signal

### ⚖️ Documentation highlighting judgment — the *why*, not just the *what*

### 🎥 **Not for the faint of heart** — a 3–4 minute video intro on your profile
#### A resume can't show how you communicate

### ⭐ Stars and followers don't matter — don't let vanity metrics stop you from shipping

<br>

> ## These show how you'd behave on a team.

Speaker notes:
AI can generate impressive-looking repos in minutes now. Hiring managers are adapting — the bar hasn't gone up, it's moved. They scan for judgment, not volume. Nobody reads 40 repos. One where you clearly thought about what you built — "I chose X over Y because Z" — beats a hundred green squares. People over-invest in polished READMEs on throwaway experiments. Spend time on the thing that's hardest to fake.
