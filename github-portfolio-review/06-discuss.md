# Let's Discuss

### 💡 What's the last thing you noticed on someone's GitHub that changed your impression of them?

### 🤖 Have you seen AI-generated repos in the wild? What tipped you off?

### 🎯 Where do you draw the line between "good enough" and "over-polished"?

### 🎤 For those interviewing: has anyone actually asked about your GitHub?

### 🛠 What would you change about your GitHub if you had a free weekend?

> ## Pick any of these, bring your own, or share a repo for live feedback.
>
> #### No judgment. The whole point is to help each other see what we're missing.
